        Here's a video. It shows what interesting consequences happen when Maa
        tries to feed the dogs. Oh, and that's Samolina in the background,
        making her snappy, high-pitched yaps.

      Socrates is the patriarch of the dogs. He has floppy Labrador ears,
      hanging jowls and two large milky (he’s half-blind) emotional eyes. His
      back and tail seems all chewed-up. That was not the case two years ago. So
      when did his fur putrefy, I hear you ask. Who chewed Soc’s fur? He chewed
      it himself. He chewed and chewed. His fur is full of nits and ticks. Of
      course, it itches like mad. His back looks bilious and his tail looks
      thin. But he is a good dog. At day, he is an old, feeble dog who is
      sleeping diurnally. At evening, he is a howling, edacious tyrant who tries
      to snatch food from my mother’s hands. He is lenient with his family in
      general, but is firm upon one point: FOOD. We give the dogs food in
      newspapers. Whenever Socrates even moves toward Nonsense during feeding
      time, she quietly slinks away. Socrates Whines sound like wails. When Soc
      is getting impatient about when his dinner is going to come, he sits in
      front of our door and lets out those special yowls of his. He has a stink
      from the wound on his back. It smells horrible. That’s why my mother wants
      to shut him out of the apartment. It can’t be helped. Nobody can stand the
      disgusting odour of Socrates’ back. He sleeps more often now. He can’t run
      fast, or jump around, or quarrel with Plato. But he sleeps well and eats
      well.

      He has a lasting enmity with Plato the Raider, a dirty street dog with a
      coarse attitude. Soc still seems frightening and big to Plato, I think, so
      the younger dog's overconfidence is a bit halted and he does not really
      attack him. But Soc’s once-ferocious snarls now crumble into creaky nasal
      whines. When The Raider comes, Nonsense rolls all over the road and wees
      herself in fear. She seems to pleading with Plato to leave Socrates alone.
      Sam sits five metres away and lets out high-pitched barks. Plato is a
      large dog, younger and more youthful then Socrates, with cinnamon-red fur,
      a lot of brawn and chutzpah and a black mark on his forehead. His growl is
      acerbic and cacophonous. He has his own territory by the road. He has a
      mate called Lhassa. Plato is mostly not at home. He goes out wandering and
      probably threatening other dogs like Socrates for their territories. His
      hench-dog, Cupcake, guards his territory. Cupcake is a red dog with a
      broad white blemish on his face. He does not seem as aggresive and
      goon-like as Plato. One day, Plato and Soc were threatening each other so
      much the situation seemed on the brink of a fight. And Socrates, although
      big, was much weaker than Plato. So Papa had to chase The Raider away with
      pebbles. But Plato the Raider is not the only enemy Socrates has. The
      canine owners of Memorial Math are Snobbs, a snub-nosed dog with Pitbull
      eyes, and his gang, Skinny, Howler, Barker and Skimpy the Stinker. Snobbs
      is belligerent and froward. He and his gang often fight with Socrates.
      Once we witnessed Snobbs' Gang in a tussle with Socrates. The five dogs
      rolled over and over. Clouds of dust were floating in the air. When the
      fight ended, Snobbs emerged victorious, with Socrates standing growling
      and surrounded by the Gang. Recently, I made friends with Barker, who is a
      large dog with a black nose and a serius expression. He was lying on the
      raised platform of Memorial Math. I gave him some cakes and petted him. He
      looked like a thinker, like Socrates. I gave food to Skinny and Howler
      also. I couldn't find Snobbs anywhere.

      Sweetiepie is Socrates’ mate. She is a flabby bitch with a motherly
      attitude towards her daughter, Nonsense. She developed an even caring
      demeanour after Nonsense nearly died of Parbo-virus, like her sister
      Chocolate. Sweetiepie allows Nonsense to eat her food. She loves chasing
      Cocky, the black cat who lives at the office. Since Sweetiepie is very
      gentle, she allows Nonsense and Socrates to eat her food. Last night,
      Sweetie did not come to eat her food. She was feeling angry because her
      mate and children always robbed her food. Papa had to go and feed her.
      Once, my family and I went on a twelve-day journey to Kolkata. The dogs
      were given food every day. Yet, when we got down from Bimal Uncle’s van,
      there was a marvellous canine welcome awaiting us. Nonsense howled and
      howled while Sam, the youngest, came up and licked everyone. Socrates let
      off a volley of squeaky whines and accusations. But Sweetie was the best.
      She twisted her hindquarters around, wagged her tail, waddled around and
      bayed louder than her darling daughter Nonsense (that’s her signature mark
      of affection). Then she leaped up and put her paws on my shoulders. I
      don’t know how she did that. She had never displayed this eccentric sign
      of welcome. Her face said
      welcome-back-what-did-you-mean-going-and-leaving-me-having-fun-give-love-right-now.
      Well, I just fled upstairs. Sweetie and Nonsense were standing right in
      front of the door. Sweetiepie has continued this tradition of embracing me
      since.
