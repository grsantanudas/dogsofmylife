    <p class="tekst">
        Now, only two puppies were left with Socrates and Sweetiepie. They were mischievous, happy bundles of furry elation. Chocolate and Nonsense both had red fur. Chocolate was all red. Nonsense had white feet, a white mark on the nose and a black-white-and-red tail. We used to feed them with dog biscuits. Papa bought a packet of Calcium Bones for them. Socrates would not let anyone touch his bone. Sweetiepie, the indulgent and doting mother of Choc and Non, would always be robbed of her bone. Chocolate had stronger teeth then Nonsense. She would quickly gulp down her bone and try to steal her sister’s. Nonsense would shield her bone with her body. Often, a mêlée would break out among the sisters over that single bone. Chocolate was more powerful then Nonsense. How was I to realize that she, she of all the dogs, was to die of a noxious malady?

        The attack came out of the blue. Papa and I had gone to feed the dogs. Soc, Sweetie and Non came rushing out. Choc was nowhere to be seen. After giving the food to an uncle of the office who was told to give Chocolate the food, we returned home. Then the news came: Chocolate had been hiding. Then I remembered. Choc had vomited her food a few days ago. Nobody realized this as the precursor of a terrible sickness. Chocolate was given medicine for three days, but to no avail. She pined, hid, and whined, petrified of the injection the vet had to give her. Finally, she succumbed to the terrible illness. She was found comatose and devoid of any sign of life, in the switchyard. I cried and cried. I really loved those pups. The other dogs were sad, too. Socrates moved less. Sweetiepie was quieter than ever. Nonsense went and lay in the spot where her sister used to sleep.
