    <h1 class="prolo">CHARACTERS</h1>

    
    <p class="tekst">SOCRATES(SOC):  A gentle old part-Labrador part-stray. He has large, sad, poignant eyes that are beautiful, though Socrates is half-blind. He has drooping jowls and floppy ears. He makes a sort of creaky whining noise when agitated, hungry or eager.</p>

  
    <p class="tekst">SWEETIEPIE: The fat mate of Socrates who was here before him. Ex-pet of Bimal Uncle, driver of the van, she never returned once released at 79 Tilla. A motherly bitch with a physique like a furry red football, Sweetie has a tendency to put her front paws on my shoulders.</p>
    
    <p class="tekst">NONSENSE: The younger daughter of Sweetiepie. She was dominated over by her sister Chocolate. Choc being dead, she is now the Royal Mischief-maker of 79 Tilla.</p>

    <p class="tekst">SAMOLINA(SAM): A puppy with glossy black fur. Socrates found her at a construction site. Adorned with a big head, a straight tail and large hazelnut eyes, Sam was frightened when first brought to 79 Tilla. Compared to Nonsense, she was Minnie Mouse. Now she is much more courageous. She almost fills the gap Chocolate left. And she is dragged around by Nonsense sixty seconds a minute.</p>

  

    <p class="tekst">CHOCOLATE: The older sister of Nonsense. Much more lively, she would finish her own Calcium Bone and try to rob her sister’s. She was infected by the lethal Parbo-virus and died after three days of hiding and agony(half of which was mine). She was found lifeless in the switchyard. I think of her even now, wagging her tail, begging for a biscuit.</p>

    
        
     <p class="tekst">PLATO THE RAIDER: An uncouth street dog with  a black mark on the forehead. Although he has a mate, Lhassa, and his own territory, he constantly comes and challenges Soc for his territory.</p>

     <p class="tekst">CUPCAKE: Plato’s hench-dog. He guards Plato’s territory most of the time, when the gully dog himself is away.</p>

     <p class="tekst">LHASSA: Plato’s mate. I have seen her only once.</p>

     <p class="tekst">SLEDGE:  A burly dog, the canine part-owner of the Ice-cream Field in Kolkata.</p>
     
     <p class="tekst">LORD: Part-owner of the Field with Sledge. He has a touch of Beagle in him.</p>
     <p class="tekst"> COCKY: A black cat of 79 Tilla.</p>
     
     <p class="tekst">SNOBBS: The snub-nosed canine owner of Memorial Math. He is bellicose, boorish and malicious. He and his gang often attack Socrates.</p>

     <p class="tekst">SNOBBS' GANG (SKINNY, BARKER, HOWLER, SKIMPY THE STINKER):As irascible as their leader Snobbs. They incessantly come to blows with Socrates for tenure of the Memorial Math.</p>
