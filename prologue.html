  <p class="tekst">Hello, readers! I  am  Saatatya Das. I am an author and a dog lover.Dogs are the jewels of animal life. Fiercely loyal and faithful, dogs like Rottweilers and Belgian Malinois make lovely guard dogs. Dogs like the Havanese, Bichon Frise, Pekingese, Shih Tzu and Lhasa Apso are cuddly lap dogs. Alsatians and Doberman Pinschers are large, fierce dogs. Lhasa Apsos and Bichon Frise are tiny little powderpuff dogs. But people must not only be attracted to high-class posh breeds. Our beautiful feral dogs that wander in the streets also have a sense of fidelity in them, equal to some breeds and more than some. We must NOT consider them as loutish “mongrels” and “strays”. We must love all dogs. In return, they give us their devotion and the soulful eyes too. In this book, you meet my local Tripuri dogs Socrates, Sweetiepie and their children. Also you meet Sledge the gentle giant of Kolkata and many others. Be ready for a beautiful canine entertainment!</p>
