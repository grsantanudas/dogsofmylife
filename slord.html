    <p class="tekst">
        But my enticing, unswerving and playful  dogs of 79 Tilla are not the only canine charms in my life. While I was away in Kolkata in the large quarter of Shapoorji Shukhobrishti, missing my dogs a bit, my mother took me to a field full of shops like teaJunction to eat some delectable strawberry ice-cream. There I saw an extremely podgy dog who looked like the male counterpart of Sweetiepie and his scraggy, Beagle-like companion with large ears. They looked as different as a balloon and a stick. Meaning that the first dog was as bloated as a balloon and the second one was as scrawny as a stick. There were other dogs in Shapoorji. Bleach was a white dog, who lived with his mate Dusky and puppy Bleach Junior. They were nomad dogs, lacking territory. Dawn was a bubbly, vivacious dog. Blanch was a tiny skinny little furtive dog who seemed to be tortured by angst and fear. He cringed when something moved or made a sound. Blanch set me thinking about how cruelly some street dogs were treated and about their increasing dread of humans. There was also lovely Bourbon, who lightly trotted about, in a lissome, red-furred body with a long face and all the majesty and elegance of a Saluki. Sledge, for so I named the corpulent dog, was a bit antsy at first. When I touched him, he recoiled and jumped up. The scrawny dog, Lord, was a bit gutsy. He was very quiet and polite. Sledge, I saw, often begged to people for biscuits or chicken sandwiches and chops. Sledge and Lord are part-owners of the Ice-cream field, like Soc is of 79 Tilla and Plato the Raider is of the Western Raider Road.

        Next day, Sledge did not protest when I caressed him. Lord was the same as before, gentle and gaunt. I gave them Parle-G biscuits, four each. But my mother and Didisona shouted, “Don’t go near that terrifying bulky dog. He’ll bite you.”. That was all baloney, of course.Some people are naturally scared of dogs. When they look into a dog's mouth and see the long, knife-like canines, it strikes fear into their hearts. They do not even pause to think if the dog has any reasonable reason to use his pointed teeth. Dogs do not bite people or hurt them without any inducement. Imagine this situation: You will see a man beating a large dog with a truncheon. The dog snaps his teeth, only meaning to warn the man. Somehow, a little portion of the man's jeans is torn off by the teeth. He is not hurt a bit. Five minutes later, the dog-catchers come and get the helpless animal. Well, why does nobody blame the spiteful man? The dog did not mean to harm him. Just his teeth nicked the man's clothes. Why do some people treat animals so cruelly and, when the animal tries to stop them, all blame goes to the creature? If animals could talk, imagine what mayhem would've happened! Everyone would know that the accuser had hurt the animals. But kind, animal-friendly people like Maa and me would never do that, of course. It's just that she was little scared, having met Sledge and Lord for the first time. Sledge is a gentle giant, like Socrates. Sledge would not harm a fly. Well, a cat, maybe.
