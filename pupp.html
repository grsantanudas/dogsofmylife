    <p class="tekst">
        Sweetiepie was a mother to a large litter long before I knew her. She could often be seen suckling a litter of eight puppies. The puppies were all cinnamon-red, like their mother. They had floppy ears and small bodies. When I knew about them, I went to visit them, bringing a packet of biscuits with me. All of them clustered around. When I dropped a biscuit, there was an immediate biscuit brouhaha among the puppies. They were happy and I was happy. They wolfed down the food. But then they were eight. Now they are two. Mostly, people came and adopted the puppies. Once, I was informed that one of the puppies was lying lifeless on the road, blood streaming from it’s forehead. Another pup was lying asleep beside it. Another pup was killed some days later. Soon, there were none left, except pesky Chocolate and her equally impish sister Nonsense. Their parents still cared for them. Formerly they’d used to reside in the old guard-house by the gate. Soon, the uncles from the Office trained them to live in the office like their mother and father. Choc and Non were untiringly gambolling around the big Grid Substation.
