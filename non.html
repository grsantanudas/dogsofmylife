      Chocolate had gone. She had taken huge chunk of my heart with her. Now
      there only remained Nonsense, the embodiment of happiness, love, peskiness
      and mischief. She would run around the complex twenty-four hours a day.
      She was cute, with large, adorable eyes and floppy ears like her
      Labrador-resembling father. Her mother simply adored her. But another dark
      cloud overshadowed the dogs. Soon, Nonsense was infected by Parbo-virus,
      the lethal disease which had robbed Chocolate of her jubilant life.
      Luckily, everyone was aware and on the alert this time. Nonsense was given
      injections and medication. But she would not eat. I tempted her with large
      Good Day biscuits, but she ignored them. Bimal Uncle mixed biscuit crumbs
      with water and filled up a syringe with this curious liquid. He inserted
      the syringe between the teeth of a reluctant Nonsense, who had been
      quietly sunning herself. She sucked in the mixture of water and biscuit. A
      few days later, I went to visit Nonsense. She was playing in front of the
      office with her mother. Nonsense looked as happy and springy as ever. She
      had a new red collar around her neck. She darted over to meet me. She was
      cured. I regretted how nobody realised Chocolate’s illness. Now Nonsense
      was cured, she would start licking everybody and pirouetting around again.

      Nonsense is in her canine preadolescence now. Her floppy ears have perked
      up. She constantly troubles Sweetie for food. She goes and pokes her
      mother and pushes her. In the afternoon, she lazily lies in the office. I
      often go and pet her. Then she bares her teeth, lifts her leg and widens
      her eyes. It is her way of expressing happiness. She, along with her old
      father, fat mother and skinny stepsister, guard the complex at night. They
      bark, yowl, howl and wail. Socrates makes his special whines. Sweetiepie
      has a special way of howling. She howls at the moon, like the foxes. She
      must have learned it from her vulpine cousins (I am speaking
      scientifically. The dogs chase the foxes around all the time). Just last
      night, Sweetie was seen giving howling classes to Nonsense. She was
      showing to which direction Nonsense must point her nose at. I don’t know
      why Sweetie admires vulpine howling.

      Nonsense mysteriously disappeared one day. Sunil Uncle said that all four
      dogs had come down to Plato the Raider's territory, the Western Raider
      Road. I supposed that Nonsense might have been lost in a narrow alley or
      gotten kidnappped or pursued by The Raider. Almost a month after Nonsense
      had vanished, when the green auto that'd take me to school had come, I
      found a thin, scrawny puppy nosing me. I inspected the cinnamon fur,
      squint-eyes, multicolored tail and white nose-mark. It was Nonsense, but
      what an avatar of her! It seemed to be the very skeleton of my darling
      puppy. Maybe she'd gotten lost in a maze of roads, lanes and alleys. Maybe
      she'd survived upon only the slushy puddles that the heavy monsoon rain
      was forming on the roads, causing her appearance as though the skin had
      been tied to her body. Her rib cages were showing through the
      now-translucent skin. I had to go to school. When I returned home under
      the radiant, scorching hot afternoon sun, I saw Nonsense sitting near the
      closed grill-gates of my house. She was ecstatic to see me, as always, but
      the joyfully orotund bark had metamorphosed into a cough-stricken
      sparrow's unsteady chirrup. I just had to care for Nonsense aka Chocopie
      (that is what we complex kids call her; I named her Nonsense). I gave her
      four biscuits. I was astounded at the disgraceful behavior of old
      Socrates. When I gave Non two Marie Gold biscuits, he came up and growled
      at his own daughter to leave the food to him and scoot. While he lets Sam
      do what she likes. Just think! I just hope Sweetie, her mother, will be
      kind to her. A bit later, Sam approached Nonsense and yapped, falsely
      thinking she was the Princess-Majesty of 79 Tilla. Non soon proved her
      very wrong, by chasing her away and pushing her into a little ditch. Now,
      we, the children of our complex, comprising of Dabbhai, Omdada and I,
      raised a contribution to give biscuits to Nonsense. Omdada stood guard
      over Socrates while I fed Nonsense, and occasionally gave a few pieces to
      Samolina, as well. Socrates is becoming the King Greediest, just as Sam is
      Princess Mischief. Why should he be so bad? Maybe he did not recognize his
      daughter through the half-blind, milky, cloudy-grey eyes. Non has some
      wounds on her tail and paws, which might have been the result of an attack
      and chase by Plato. I have promised Nonsense that I'll get her back into
      the healthy avatar in a week.

      Samolina and Nonsense are having a horrible arguement. Nonsense is
      thinking that she is the daughter by birth of Old Dog Socrates and
      rightful heiress of 79 Tilla and that Sam is just a little picked-up
      puppy. While Sam is yapping out with all the might of her strange voice
      and slim, black body that Nonsense left her home and went away, so why
      should the other puppy not be here? They often fight. Once, Nonsense
      pushed Sam into Rina Aunty's beautiful row of plastic flowerpots which
      contained eye-catching orchids, petunias and hydrangeas. Samolina nipped
      Non on her nose.
